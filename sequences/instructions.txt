Time Step - 0.01
	The rate at which the control loop on the RoboRio runs
	Units are in seconds
Velocity - Theoretically 17 - let's figure out what it actually is
	The max velocity rate your robot is capable of achieving
	Units are in ft/s
Acceleration - Cheesy Poofs use 10 - let's try that?
	The max acceleration rate your robot is capable of achieving
	Units are in ft/s/s
Jerk - Cheesy Poofs use 60 - let's try that?
	The rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time
	Units are in ft/s/s/s
Wheel Base - theoretically it's 26inches which 2.15 ft - we can calculate the actual though
The distance between your left and right wheels
Units are in feet

All points are relative meaning you do not have to start at 0,0
X
	Forward and Backwards movement of the robot
	Inrease X to move forwards
	Decrease X to move backwards
Y
	Left and Right movement of the robot
	Inrease Y to move left
	Decrease Y to move right
Angle
	This is the ending angle after the robot reaches the point
	The first point should always have an angle of Zero
